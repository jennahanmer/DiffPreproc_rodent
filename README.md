# DiffPreproc_rodent
Preprocessing Pipeline for rodent diffusion MRI. 

Limitations

There is currently still a need to manually confirm that the bvecs are aligned correctly
with the orientation of the diffusion weighted images. Any reorientation of the bvec 
files needs to be complete before running DiffPreproc_rodent. 

Development

Developed by Jenna Hanmer and Stamatios Sotiropoulos.
This is still a work-in-progress.
